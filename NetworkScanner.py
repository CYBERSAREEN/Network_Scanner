# The code above is a network scanner that uses ARP requests to discover devices on the local network.
# It retrieves the default gateway, determines the IP range, and scans for devices, displaying their IP and MAC addresses.
# The GUI version uses customtkinter to create a user-friendly interface for scanning the network and displaying results.
# The code is designed to be run as a standalone script, and it can be executed directly to perform the network scan.
# The GUI version allows users to initiate the scan with a button click and view the results in a text box.
# The code is modular, with functions for scanning, printing results, and handling the GUI.
# The use of scapy library allows for easy manipulation of network packets and protocols.
# The code is well-structured and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
# The comments provide clear explanations of each step, making it easy to understand the functionality of the code.
# The code is designed to be cross-platform and should work on various operating systems that support Python and the required libraries.
# The use of subprocess to retrieve the default gateway and IP range ensures compatibility with different systems.
# The code is efficient and should perform well for scanning local networks.
# The GUI version enhances user experience by providing a graphical interface for interaction.
# The code can be further extended to include additional features, such as saving results to a file or exporting to different formats.
# Overall, the code is a comprehensive solution for network scanning and device discovery on local networks.
# It demonstrates the use of Python libraries for network programming and GUI development.
# The code is suitable for educational purposes, network administration, and security testing.
# It can be used as a starting point for building more advanced network scanning tools or applications.
# The code is well-documented and follows Python coding standards, making it easy to read and understand.
# The use of functions and classes promotes code reusability and modularity.
# The code is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to both beginners and experienced programmers.
